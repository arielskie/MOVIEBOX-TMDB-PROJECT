# ABEFILM - Blogger Movie & TV Template Powered by TMDB API

Welcome to **ABEFILM**, a dynamic movie and TV series website built on the Blogger platform, powered by **The Movie Database (TMDB) API**. This project enables users to browse, search, and explore movies, TV series, anime, and animations with real-time data fetched directly from TMDB.

## Introduction

ABEFILM uses TMDB API endpoints to display movie and TV show data within Blogger widgets and custom scripts. The site supports various categories and advanced filtering by genre, release year, region, and language — designed for easy use and customization on Blogger.

**Note:**  
No posting or data submission is done through this integration. It only fetches and displays data from TMDB.
